# IoT Device Simulation and Data Transmission with Kafka, RabbitMQ

A system that simulates IoT devices and transmits information to a central server using two different message queues: RabbitMQ and Kafka. 
RabbitMQ and Kafka were used with Docker to enhance scalability and deployment flexibility.

## Code Functionality Overview

Main files for RabbitMQ and Kafka are producer.py and consumer.py.

4-consumer.py and 4-producer.py correspond to the use of different communication channels.
